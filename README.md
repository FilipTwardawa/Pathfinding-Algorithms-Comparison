## 🔍 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Python application for visualizing and comparing various pathfinding algorithms, including **BFS**, **Dijkstra**, and **A***. The application leverages graph theory to demonstrate how different algorithms perform in finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

The project generates performance comparison charts that highlight execution time, path cost, and the number of visited nodes for each algorithm. It includes utilities for graph visualization and analysis.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Pathfinding Algorithms**  
Implements BFS, Dijkstra, and A* algorithms with customizable heuristics for finding the shortest paths in graphs.

📊 **Graph Visualization**  
Uses NetworkX to create and manipulate graph structures for visual representation.

📈 **Performance Comparison Charts**  
Generates bar charts to compare the performance metrics of different pathfinding algorithms, such as execution time, path cost, and visited nodes.

🧪 **Modular and Testable Code**  
The codebase is structured in a modular way to ensure it is easy to test, maintain, and extend.
