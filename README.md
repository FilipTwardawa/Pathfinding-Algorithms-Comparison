## üîç Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Python application for visualizing and comparing various pathfinding algorithms, including BFS, Dijkstra, and A*. The application leverages graph theory to demonstrate how different algorithms perform in finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph.

The project generates performance comparison charts that highlight execution time, path cost, and the number of visited nodes for each algorithm. It includes utilities for graph visualization and analysis.
