# Testing Overview

## Purpose

The **Testing** module ensures that all components of the application are functioning as expected. This includes verifying the correctness, performance, and integration of pathfinding algorithms, core modules, and the overall application pipeline.

### Testing Strategy

1.**Unit Tests**:

   - Test individual modules and functions in isolation.
   - Ensure that edge cases are handled correctly.

2.**Integration Tests**:

   - Validate the interaction between multiple components.
   - Simulate real-world scenarios to ensure the application behaves as intended.

3.**Performance Tests**:

   - Benchmark algorithm execution time on large datasets.
   - Ensure scalability for production-level use cases.

### Test Organization

The tests are categorized as follows:

- **Algorithms**: Verify the correctness of pathfinding algorithms.
- **Core Modules**: Validate the foundational components, such as graph processing and visualization.
- **Integration**: Test the complete application pipeline, from graph initialization to path reconstruction and visualization.
