# Algorithms

## BFS
Visits every node belonging to one depth, then moves further. Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs. It uses queue to control visited nodes.

## Dijkstra

Finds shortest path in graph with positive weights. Uses priority queue to choose brst current node. It actualises route costs to visited nodes in following iterations.

## A*
Combines both real route costs and estimated distance by using heuristic function. It performs well thanks to fast execution and optimal route finding.
