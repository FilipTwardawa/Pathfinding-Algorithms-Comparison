# Pathfinding-Algorithms-Comparison

This repository provides a comparative analysis of three popular path finding algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* (A-star) Algorithm and the use of Heuristic Functions in finding the shortest path. The project aims to evaluate and analyse the performance, efficiency and behaviour of these algorithms in finding optimal paths.
