# Pathfinding Algorithms Comparison

---

---

Welcome to the **Pathfinding Algorithms Comparison** project! This tool compares the performance of multiple pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra, A*, and Breadth-First Search (BFS), on real-world graph data.


---

---

## Why This Project?
Pathfinding algorithms are core to navigation systems, robotics, and gaming. This project simplifies their comparison using visual and performance-based metrics, enabling deeper insights into their behavior on real-world data.

## Key Features
#### 1. Algorithm Implementations

- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Computes the shortest path by iterating through the nodes with the smallest tentative distance.

- A* (A-Star Algorithm): Optimized for graph traversal with heuristics for better performance.

- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all neighbors level by level, ideal for unweighted graphs.

#### 2. Visualization

- Real-time visual representation of graph traversal.

- Animated GIFs showing step-by-step pathfinding processes.

- Customizable node and edge styles.

#### 3. Metrics Comparison

- Compare algorithms on metrics like:

    - Execution Time (in seconds).
        
    - Path Cost (sum of edge weights).
        
    - Steps (number of iterations).
        
    - Path Length (number of edges in the path).
  

- Generate charts for visual comparisons.

#### 4. Feature Flags

*Integrated with Flagsmith to enable or disable functionalities dynamically, such as algorithm visualization and comparisons.*

#### 5. Testing

- Comprehensive test suite with:

    - Unit tests for individual modules.
    
    - Integration tests for pipeline validation.
    
    - Performance benchmarks for algorithms.
