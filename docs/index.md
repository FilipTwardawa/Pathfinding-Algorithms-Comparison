# Pathfinding Algorithms Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Pathfinding Algorithms project!

## Overview
This project provides a robust framework for comparing and visualizing pathfinding algorithms such as:
- **Dijkstra**
- **A*** 
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

Key features:
- Real-time graph visualization and GIF generation.
- Algorithm performance comparison.
- Modular structure for extensibility.
